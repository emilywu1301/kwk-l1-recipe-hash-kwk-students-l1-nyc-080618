#code your solutions here

#1. Create a hash called `perfect_10_recipe` that has the following data:

#  - almond flour - 2 cups
#  - gluten freewhole oats - 1 cup
#  - kosher salt - 1/2 tea spoon
#  - baking powder  - 1/2 tea spoon
#  - baking soda - 1/4 tea spoon
#  - Xanthan Gum - 1/2 tea spoon
#  - slivered almonds, lightly toasted - 1/4 cup
#  - mini dark chocolate chips - 3/4 cup
#  - olive oil - 1/2 cup
#  - agave - 1/4 cup
# All of the ingredients should be symbols and the amounts should be strings. Remember that symbols start with a colon and be sure to sub underscores for spaces.

perfect_10_recipe = {}
perfect_10_recipe[:almond_flour]="2 cups"
perfect_10_recipe[:gluten_freewhole_oats]="1 cup"
perfect_10_recipe[:kosher_salt]="1/2 teaspoon"
perfect_10_recipe[:baking_powder]="1/2 teaspoon"
perfect_10_recipe[:baking_soda]="1/4 teaspoon"
perfect_10_recipe[:xanthan_gum]="1/2 teaspoon"
perfect_10_recipe[:slivered_almonds_lightly_toasted]="1/4 cup"
perfect_10_recipe[:mini_dark_chocolate_chips]="3/4 cup"
perfect_10_recipe[:olive_oil]="1/2 cup"
perfect_10_recipe[:agave]="1/4 cup"
puts perfect_10_recipe

#2. Write a method that simply returns (not puts) your perfect_10 hash

def recipe_ingredients(perfect_10_recipe)
  return perfect_10_recipe
end

recipe_ingredients(perfect_10_recipe)

#2: Write code that returns the amount of chocolate chips from perfect_10 ingredients that is needed in the recipe.

def amount_of_chocolate_chips(perfect_10_recipe)
  puts perfect_10_recipe[:mini_dark_chocolate_chips]
end
amount_of_chocolate_chips(perfect_10_recipe)

#3: Use `puts` to print out every ingredient and amount in the hash by iterating through the collection. You'll want to use the `each` method.

def ingredients_and_amounts(perfect_10_recipe)
  ingredients = perfect_10_recipe.keys
  amounts = perfect_10_recipe.values
 perfect_10_recipe.each do |ingredients, amounts|
   puts "#{ingredients} : #{amounts}"
 end
end

ingredients_and_amounts(perfect_10_recipe)

#4: Now use `puts` to print out just the ingredients without the amounts. You'll want to use the `each_key` method.

def ingredients(perfect_10_recipe)
  puts perfect_10_recipe.keys
end

ingredients(perfect_10_recipe)

#5: Now use `puts` to print out just the amounts without the ingredients. You'll want to use the `each_value` method.
def amounts(perfect_10_recipe)
  puts perfect_10_recipe.values
end

amounts(perfect_10_recipe)

#6: Return the number of ingredients in the `perfect_10_recipe` hash.
def number_ingredients(perfect_10_recipe)
  puts perfect_10_recipe.keys.size
end

number_ingredients(perfect_10_recipe)
